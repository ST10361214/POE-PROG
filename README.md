The recent updates to the RecipeApp1 application focused on refining its structure and functionality based on feedback. Key improvements include correcting XAML namespaces for proper local referencing (local and local1) and replacing PlaceholderText with Text attributes in TextBox elements, resolving related errors. Event handlers (GotFocus and LostFocus) were implemented for TextBoxes to manage placeholder text effectively, enhancing user interaction. Button click event logic (e.g., AddIngredient_Click, AddStep_Click) was integrated into MainWindow.xaml.cs, ensuring validation and interaction with the RecipeViewModel for adding, displaying, scaling, resetting, and clearing recipes. The ViewModel (RecipeViewModel) was refined to optimize data binding and command execution, using ObservableCollection for ingredients and steps, and incorporating logic for managing original states and filtering recipes by user-defined criteria, thus improving maintainability and usability of the application.
Instructions:
Open Visual Studio: Launch Visual Studio, ensuring the solution file (.sln) for RecipeApp1 is loaded.

Build Solution: Click on the "Build" menu and select "Build Solution" (or press Ctrl+Shift+B). This compiles the entire solution, ensuring all code and dependencies are processed.

Set Startup Project: Right-click on the project (likely named RecipeApp1) in the Solution Explorer, select "Set as Startup Project".

Run the Application: Press F5 or click on the "Start" button (a green arrow) in the Visual Studio toolbar to run the application. This action will build the project (if not already built) and start the application.

Interact with the Application: Once launched, interact with the graphical user interface (GUI) of RecipeApp1 as intended. Add ingredients and steps, perform operations like scaling, resetting, clearing recipes, and apply filters to explore recipe functionalities.
